        Hi, my name is Nic Ollis and I’m a software development consultant who specializes in business growth through increasing conversion rates, developing new services, and bringing new businesses online, whether startup or an established enterprise.


        Unlike other developers or consultants, I’m both an experienced multiindustry tech consulting and an active developer, so I can create a path that achieves your business goals, is competitive within your field, and is technically feasible.
     

        I work on the experience of your apps across all screen sizes, to focus on the little things that turn guest into customers. I bring a passion for your business to web or mobile to deliver an increased user engagement.

      <h4>What does Nic do?</h4>

      <p>
        I have worked with CEO’s, VC’s, and other senior members on what best web and mobile technologies to use so to achieve their goals. The result is everyone is on the same page, and they have an app that is easy to build and iterate on.

        I create detailed development plans and design documents and develop tested applications in rapid development cycles. The result is alpha and beta versions in the hands of testers early on, and a great foundation for future growth.

        I offer long-term maintenance plans for apps. The result is worry free and always updated applications at predictable expenses so you can focus on business.

        I help local shops leverage the web and mobile platforms to stay ahead on their competitors and attract new patrons. The result is increased brand awareness and loyalty helping in business growth.
      </p>
